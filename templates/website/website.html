        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Denny Lu, a passionate photographer based in Irvine, CA. My journey into photography began in my hometown of Temecula, where I was always inspired by the vivid landscapes and vibrant community. I attended Great Oak High School, where I graduated with a notable 4.33 GPA, which set the stage for my academic journey at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My dedication to community service has been a vital part of my life, earning me the prestigious Gold Presidential Service Award and a Congressional Service Award. I have honed my skills and professionalism over 5 years working at McDonald's, where I learned the value of hard work, teamwork, and customer satisfaction.</p>

Over the years, I have worked on numerous projects, ranging from intimate portraits to expansive landscapes. My work captures the essence of any given moment, ensuring that each photograph speaks aloud the unspoken word. I continuously strive to push the boundaries of creativity while maintaining an elegant and simplistic aesthetic that defines my visual style. My passion is fueled by the joy of capturing the perfect shot, whether it's the candid smile of a stranger or the breathtaking view from a hilltop at sunset.</p>
